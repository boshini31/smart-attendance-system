SMART-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM-USING DEEP LEARNING
    A web-based Smart Attendance System using AI and face recognition to automate attendance marking.
   Replace traditional attendance methods with a faster, more accurate, and contactless solution.
  An intuitive, easy-to-use web app for admins to manage attendance, user profiles, and reports.
    Detects and recognizes faces from live video streams or pre-recorded footage through the web interface.
    AI-powered recognition algorithms match faces to a pre-existing database for automatic attendance.
  Attendance is marked automatically once the face is detected and recognized.
  Each attendance entry is logged with an accurate timestamp of when the recognition occurred.
   Admins can easily add, update, or remove users and manage their photos via the web app.
    The system generates and exports real-time attendance reports with user names and timestamps.
   AI ensures precise face identification with quick processing, even for large groups.
  The system can be scaled for classrooms, offices, events, or large gatherings.
    User data is securely processed and stored, complying with data protection regulations.
   Attendance data can be synced to the cloud for easy access and sharing.
  Stores attendance records and user profiles in a database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for easy management.
     The system can work without internet access in remote locations, saving data locally until connected.
